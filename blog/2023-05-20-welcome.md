My previous blog can be found [here](https://akacoder404.github.io) which used the [chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) template. However, I found it relatively hard to customize, using jekly and graphql. Then while learning about prompt engineering [here](https://www.google.com.hk/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=learnprompt&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8#bsht=Cgdic2h3Y2hwEgQIBDAB&ip=1), the UI of the website really caught my attention. That is when I found [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io). I liked the simplicity of the base design, but the flexible customization as it is built on Reactjs, something I am familiar with.

So this is my first post. Welcome to my website! I hope to maintain a blog, a list of projects that I have completed, and tutorials about topics I am interested in.
